# Testing React TODO App

This is the app we will be testing. http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/

In a real world BDD environment you wouldn't be testing an already made application, but instead practicing collaboration
with your peers and defining new features as we come up with them. Unfortunately developing our own app is out of scope
for what we want to teach here, so instead we are going to treat this already developed app as if we were just now
describing the features we wanted to create.

We will be working together as a class to:
1. Write user stories to describe features
2. Write acceptance criteria for those user stories
3. Implement the step definitions to fulfill our acceptance criteria.

Some things to keep in mind as we work:
* Is any story too big? Can we break them down to provide incremental value to our customers?
* Are we making sure to only describe behaviour and not implementation in our acceptance criteria?
* How readable are our specifications? Could somebody new to the project understand the desired functionality?
